## 📝 Description

The Azure-Based Demand Forecasting & Capacity Optimization System is a sophisticated cloud-native solution designed to bridge the gap between predictive analytics and operational execution. By harnessing the full power of the Microsoft Azure ecosystem, this project provides a robust framework for processing large-scale datasets to generate highly accurate demand forecasts. The system translates these predictions into actionable capacity strategies, allowing organizations to dynamically adjust their resources, minimize waste, and maintain optimal service levels. Ideal for supply chain management and infrastructure scaling, this end-to-end pipeline integrates advanced machine learning models with automated cloud workflows to ensure data-driven decision-making at every level of the enterprise.
